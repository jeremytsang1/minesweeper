* Description
My personal implementation of the classic [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)][Minesweeper game]].
* Rules
- The objective of the game is to open all cells not containing mines. If the player opens a cell containing a mine they lose the round. Note that when opening a cell there are three options to its contents:
  1) containing a bomb
  2) containing a the number of adjacent cells that contain bombs
  3) empty (no adjacent cells contain bombs)

- The player is capable of the 3 following actions
** Opening a cell
This will open a single cell. If the cell contains a bomb the player dies. If it contains a number then only the opened cell is opened. If is empty all adjacent cells are opened (i.e. opening all cells reachable to the opened cell stopping only at number cells).
** Toggling a flag on a cell
This can be used to mark a cell as having a bomb. This is useful for /chording/ as seen below.
** Chording a cell
If a given number cell has a number of flags adjacent equal to its number it can be [[http://www.minesweeper.info/wiki/Chord][chorded]]. This means all non-flagged unopened cells will be opened as if they were opened as in (1). If a flag is not properly assigned (i.e. flagging a cell that does not contain a bomb) this could lead to the player's death.
* Requirements
- Python ~>= 3.6~
- For specific Python packages see ~requirements.txt~.
* Installation
** Option 1: Local
- Unzip the ~.zip~ file.
- ~cd~ into the top root directory of the unzipped file.
- Install dependencies
  #+begin_src bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
  #+end_src
- Run the main script
  #+begin_src 
python3 main.py
  #+end_src
- Follow instructions on terminal to choose TUI or GUI mode.

** Option 2: ~repl.it~
1) Navigate to the following link: [[https://repl.it/@jatsang52/minesweeper#main.py]]
   [[file:screenshots/repl-it-step-1.png]]   
2) In the repl.it terminal, install dependencies with ~pip install -r requirements.txt~
   [[file:screenshots/repl-it-step-2.png]]   
3) After the installation completes press the ~Run~ button.
   [[file:screenshots/repl-it-step-3.png]]
4) In the repl.it terminal choose TUI or GUI mode.
   [[file:screenshots/repl-it-step-4.png]]
5) In the repl.it terminal if you choose GUI mode make sure to choose option ~1~ to disable sound (repl.it doesn't play nicely with pygame apps with sound)
